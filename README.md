# Clicky-Crates

A minimalist Crate Clicking game made in Unity.

## ðŸŽ® Gameplay
You have to click on crates that randomly spawn from the bottom of the screen. 
Clicking on Skulls will reduce your points, while clicking on a crate will increase them.
If you miss clicking a crate, the game is over.
